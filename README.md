Deep_Learning Imagenet Network
=============

ImageNet network implementation. Implemented Imagenet using opencv routines. Used already existing network of imagenet for testing.

Both forward and backward propogation implemented and each layer gives gives exact results as MatconvNet and caffe implementation.


Implementation of lenet and imagenet using opencv routines. We plan to make network fast with opencv gpu routines.
